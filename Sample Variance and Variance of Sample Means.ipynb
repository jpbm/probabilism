    "# Sample Variance and Variance of Sample Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Two expressions float around that allow the inference of the population variance based on samples that are drawn. In one case, $\\sigma_p^2/(n-1)$, and in the other case $\\sigma_p^2/n$. Especially during times of prolonged peace, that can already be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're actually both correct, and they both have to do with drawing samples, and they're both frequently called $\\sigma_s$. The thing is that the context is two very different calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Means\n",
    "A collection of $N$ samples are drawn from a population. The samples each have size $n$. When the mean of the each of the $N$ samples is calculated, it turns out that the $N$ sample means have a distribution that has mean equal to the population mean, and variance equal to $\\sigma_p^2/n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if you have a bunch of samples, you can infer the population variance by looking at the distribution of the means of the samples you took.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Variance\n",
    "A single sample of size $n$ is drawn from a population. The variance of the $n$ members of the sample is $\\sigma_p^2/(n-1)$."
