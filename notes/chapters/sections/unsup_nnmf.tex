\section{$\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{W}\mathbf{H}$ Non-Negative Matrix Factorization}

Non-Negative Matrix Factorization works for positive matrices and is interesting as a method for dimensionality reduction. It works by expressing a matrix $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}_+$ in terms of two smaller positive matrices $\mathbf{W}\in\mathbb{R}_+^{p\times r}$ and $\mathbf{H}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times n}_+$. An excellent introduction is in \possessivecite{morningpaper2019nnmf} blog post and in \citeasnoun{gillis2014and}. 

Dimensionality reduction derives from the ability to adjust the rank of the decomposition via the dimension $r$.
