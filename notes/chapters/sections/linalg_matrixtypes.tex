\section{Types of Matrices}

\subsection{Triangular}
A lower triangular matrix is a matrix that has all-zero entries above the diagonal.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L} = \left[\begin{array}{cccccc} l_{1,1}&&&&&0\\l_{2,1}&l_{2,2}&&&&\\l_{3,1}&l_{3,2}&\ddots&&&\\  \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&&\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\ddots&\ddots&\\  l_{n,1}&l_{n,2}&\hdots&\hdots&l_{n,n-1}&l_{n,n}\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

Upper triangular matrices are matrices that have all-zero entries below the diagonal.


% Hermitian / Symmetric
\subsection{$\mathbf{A}^{\dagger} = \mathbf{A}$ Hermitian, Symmetric}
Hermitian matrices are matrices that are equal to their complex transpose. That is:

\begin{equation}
{\mathbf{A}^{*}}^T = \mathbf{A}^\dagger = \mathbf{A} 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Properties}
There are many properties of Hermitian matrices. 
\begin{itemize}
\item By definition: $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^\dagger$
\item Diagonal Entries are all real, since $a_{i,i} = a_{i,i}^*$
\item Inverse is also hermitian:  $\mathbf{A}^{-1} ={ \mathbf{A}^{-1}}^\dagger$
\item Diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors $\in \mathbb{C}^n$.
\end{itemize}


Hermitian matrices with only real entries are called symmetric matrices. In that case $\mathbf{A}^T = \mathbf{A}$.


% Skew Hermitian / Skew Symmetric
\subsection{$\mathbf{A}^{\dagger} = -\mathbf{A}$ Skew Hermitian, Skew Symmetric}
Skew Hermitian matrices that are equal to the negative of their complex transpose. That is:

\begin{equation}
{\mathbf{A}^{*}}^T = \mathbf{A}^\dagger = -\mathbf{A} 
\end{equation}

Real matrices that are skew Hermitian are called skew symmetric. In that case:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}^T = -\mathbf{A} 
\end{equation}


% Unitary / Orthogonal
\subsection{$\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}$ Unitary, Orthogonal}
Unitary matrices satisfy $\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{UU}^{\dagger}=\mathbf{I}$, and they have $det(\mathbf{U}) = 1$. They are diagonalizable and can be expressed as $e^{i\mathbf{H}}$ where $\mathbf{H}$ is a Hermitian matrix. Rotation matrices in complex space are Unitary. For real matrices, unitary matrices are the same as orthogonal matrices.

Unitary matrices that are real are called orthogonal.  Orthogonal matrices satisfy $\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^T$. The rows (and columns) of $\mathbf{A}$ are an orthonormal basis in $\mathrm{R}^n$.
