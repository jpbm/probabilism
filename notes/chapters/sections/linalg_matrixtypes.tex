\section{Types of Matrices}

\subsection{$\mathbf{A}^{dagger} = \mathbf{A}$ Hermitian}
Hermitian matrices are matrices that are equal to their complex transpose. That is:

\begin{equation}
{\mathbf{A}^{*}}^T = \mathbf{A}^\dagger = \mathbf{A} 
\end{equation}


Hermitian matrices are like a generalization of symmetric matrices to include complex numbers. 

\subsubsection{Properties}
There are many properties. 
\begin{itemize}
\item By definition: $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^\dagger$
\item Diagonal Entries are all real, since $a_{i,i} = a_{i,i}^*$
\item Inverse is also hermitian:  $\mathbf{A}^{-1} ={ \mathbf{A}^{-1}}^\dagger$
\item Diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors $\in \mathbb{C}^n$.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{$\mathbf{A}^{\datter} = -\mathbf{A}$ Skew Hermitian}
Skew Hermitian matrices that are equal to the negative of their complex transpose. That is:

\begin{equation}
{\mathbf{A}^{*}}^T = \mathbf{A}^\dagger = -\mathbf{A} 
\end{equation}



\subsection{Triangular}
A lower triangular matrix is a matrix that has all-zero entries above the diagonal.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L} = \left[\begin{array}{cccccc} l_{1,1}&&&&&0\\l_{2,1}&l_{2,2}&&&&\\l_{3,1}&l_{3,2}&\ddots&&&\\  \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&&\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\ddots&\ddots&\\  l_{n,1}&l_{n,2}&\hdots&\hdots&l_{n,n-1}&l_{n,n}\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

Upper triangular matrices are matrices that have all-zero entries below the diagonal.


\subsection{$\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}$ Unitary}
Unitary matrices satisfy $\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{UU}^{\dagger}=\mathbf{I}$, and they have $det(\mathbf{U}) = 1$. They are diagonalizable and can be expressed as $e^{i\mathbf{H}}$ where $\mathbf{H}$ is a Hermitian matrix. Rotation matrices in complex space are Unitary. For real matrices, unitary matrices are the same as orthogonal matrices.

\subsection{$\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}$ Orthogonal} 
Orthogonal matrices satisfy $\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^T$. The rows (and columns) of $\mathbf{A}$ are an orthonormal basis.
