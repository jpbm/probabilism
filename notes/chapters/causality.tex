\section{Generalized Random Forests}
Notes on \citeasnoun{athey2016generalized}. Like most regression techniques, random forests are normally used to estimate the conditional mean of some data generating distribution, i.e. $\mu(x) = \mathbb{E}\left[Y|X=x \right]$. Athey, Tibshirani and Wager proposed generalized random forests, which estimate, more generally, some quantity $\theta(x)$. The main aim, and the reason why I am grouping this method under ``causality", is the estimation of heterogenous treatment effects.
