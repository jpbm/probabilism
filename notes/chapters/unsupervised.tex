\section{Blind Source Separation}
Blind Source Separation or Blind Signal Separation (BSS) is the separation of mixed signals. An example is the cocktail party problem, where a microphone is recording the conversations of many people speaking at the same time, making the recording unintelligible. Successful BSS would be able to extract the voice of only a single person.

\section{Independent Component Analysis (ICA)}
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a decomposition of data into components that have vanishing mutual information.
